                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season.

Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts.

                            <h2><a href="javascript:void(0)">Webb Simpson projects as a top value play</a></h2>
                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts.

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>

                            <p>The RotoGrinders DraftKings players projections have Webb Simpson ranked at the top play in terms of PT/$K. Simpson's last victory came at the 2013 Shiners Hospital for Children Open. The USGA announced its future ban of any anchored putters during the 2014 season. The ban started on January 1st 2016 and was put into place in order prevent players from anchoring any part of a putter to their body. Simpson's preferred putting style prior to the news of the ban required the use an anchored belly putter. Unlike many other players who used an anchored putter, Simpson chose to make the switch long before the start of the 2016 season. Simpson's decline in performance can be directly linked to his lack of ability to constantly hole putts. Simpson has an excellent tee to green game, and when his putter gets hot he has shown that he can still compete on the PGA tour. With three top 25 finishes in last six starts Simpson projects to be an excellent value play at this year's Travelers Championship.</p>
